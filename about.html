			   <p style="column"> A Long Time Ago, in a Galaxy Far Far Away I was born. The city called Pushkin is located near the cultural capital Saint Petersburg in the county named Russia. My birthday is on 9th February 1997, I know I`m pretty young, but what can I do? I have a big family, which consists of my parents, two older brother and a cat. I really love and miss my cat (Nusha), because she is the one for me and I can pet her as much as I want. However, she might not like it :) As a small child I always liked to do sports, probably because of my brothers effect, so I was very active. I think it started when my brother wanted to play me with (1year old), he imagined that my baby carriage is a car, so he pushed me. As a result, I was laying and crying on the ground. Nevertheless, I enjoy sports and wishing to pass for the driving license. I broke an arm and almost a knee. Not that proud of it, but will have few stories to tell to my children. Oh, about children, I want to have a biiig family, means around 12 children. Each of them would do something what I like, for example, badminton, football, dance, music, drawing and many more :)</p>
